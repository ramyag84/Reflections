1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

when we initialize a repository a .git file gets created which holds the metadata of the history of the files contained in the git repository.

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is the place where all the logical files are grouped first before making a single commit.

3 .How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

We can add only those files that are logically connected to each other wrt any changes and then commit all of them together.

4. What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Branches would be helpful to preserve the master as it is and try out some other new features in a seperate branch. Hence the working master is not affected.
