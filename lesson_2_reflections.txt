1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

when we initialize a repository a .git file gets created which holds the metadata of the history of the files contained in the git repository.

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is the place where all the logical files are grouped first before making a single commit.
