1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    

I would prefer using a remote directory if i want to share my files to others on a day to day basis . Or if i use 
different computers to continue with my 
work.


2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Just to ensure that it is certainly in sync.
