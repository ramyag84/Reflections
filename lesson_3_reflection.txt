1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    

I would prefer using a remote directory if i want to share my files to others on a day to day basis . Or if i use 
different computers to continue with my 
work.


2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Just to ensure that it is certainly in sync.

3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A fork is a glone directly from one github repository to another git hub repository. This is used if you want to use someone elses files, make changes to it and share them again, where it is necessary to keep track of the original repository from where we cloned it. 
A clone is done from a github repository to a local computer. This is done if we want to copy someone's files and make changes to it. But we dont need to know from where we copied them.
A branch is a non-linear extension of the master. This is juzt to add an extra feature without affecting the master file.

4. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

5. How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

it would be really harder to collaborate without using Git or GitHub as we might have to share the file to and fro in other means like ftp etc.

6. When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

to always have a working master which never breaks.
